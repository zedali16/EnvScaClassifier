Description:
    - functions.r: contains all necessary functions to run simulations.

    - demo_case1.r: demonstrates the proposed method for Case 1 in the simulation studies.

    - demo_case2.r: demonstrates the proposed method for Case 1 in the simulation studies.

    - demo_case3.r: demonstrates the proposed method for Case 1 in the simulation studies.

    - seql executables (folder): contains necessary C++ implementation of the sequence learner  (Ifrim and Wiuf, 2011).

Dependencies:
The packages listed in the demo files must also be installed prior to use: astsa and abind
